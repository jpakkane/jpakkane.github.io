          <i>The Meson Manual</i> is a full user's manual for
          the <a href="https://meson.build">Meson build system</a>
          written by Jussi Pakkanen, the original creator and current
          project lead of Meson. Written in an informative and concise
          no-nonsense style, the text makes the material easily
          approachable even for people with little previous knowledge
          on build systems in general or Meson in particular. Plenty
          of practical examples are used to ensure that the
          information is readily usable on real world projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book starts with the basics such as how compilers and
          linkers work, what is the difference between static and
          dynamic linking (both at compile time and at runtime) and
          some differences between different toolchains and operating
          systems. This is followed by a thorough description of
          Meson's syntax, behaviour and functionality. A few bigger
          projects are examined to see how all of this can be applied
          to real world projects. The second half of the book is a
          thorough reference manual of all Meson functionality,
          including sample code for almost every function, module and
          method.

        <h2>Availability</h2>
        <p>
          This book is only available for purchase on this web site as
          a downloadable PDF.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we would love to make this book available to all
          countries in the world, it is not possible due to reasons
          beyond our control. Several countries have laws stating that
          anyone selling any goods to that country must register in,
          collect and pay taxes and deal with all related bureaucracy
          of the country in question. This is an unreasonable burden
          on small independent publishers, so unfortunately purchases
          from these countries have been blocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blocked countries include, but are not limited to, Russia,
          India, UAE and South Korea.
